Analysis of crime in Dallas, Texas, using R
Large cities like Dallas have historically struggled with crime, so the Center for Policing Equity (CPE) and police agencies across the country teamed up to produce open-source crime data. This enables data analysts to find trends and produce insightful information for decision-makers to enhance public safety. Working in this field is quite dangerous due to its nature. By examining data on injuries sustained by police officers in Dallas, we can obtain useful insights about the risks involved and identify potential improvements.

In this project, and with the help of open-source data from Kaggle containing information about the different types of incidents in Dallas during the year 2016â€“2017, we will determine which instances are more likely to result in an injury or hospitalization. This information might help identify dangerous encounters and prepare in advance to handle them.
